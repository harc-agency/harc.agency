Project 1: detailed explanation of the project

This is a detailed explanation of the project. It should be written in a way that is easy to understand for a non-technical person. I recommend using the following structure:

Project 1 is the first topic in html for a brand new, never before seen, student.

# Project 1

<!-- 
Leslie, Tanner and Dustin will be using the following script to record the video. 

Leslie: will be introducing the project and explaining the project, as well as Dustin and Tanner. this will be the first time that the students see the project. 

Dustin: will be explaining the project in more detail, and will be explaining the code.
Tanner: will be explaining the project in more detail, and will be explaining the code.

There should be a dialog between the three of them. This is to introduce the project. Getting the students excited about the project, as well as to get them to understand the project.

This will be the intro video priming the students for the project. No code should be written in this video. That will be done in the next video.

The Goal of this video will be achieved by the following script:
    - Leslie will introduce the project [Stork], as well as Dustin and Tanner. 
    - Dustin and Tanner, will introduce themselves some of the mentors for the project.
    - As mentors, they will be helping with over the course of the project. Answering questions, and helping with the project.
    - After the introduction of the mentors, Leslie will explain the project briefly.
    - Once all have done this wrap up the video.
